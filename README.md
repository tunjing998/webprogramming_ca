# TBD

In this project our team built a **Remote Hosted Website** on a topic: **TBD -To Be Defined**, fashion and jewellery online shop. We implemented this richly-featured database-driven MVC web application with a server-side(*PHP*) and a client-side(*JavaScript/AJAX/CSS*), applied a Bootstrap front-end framework and a secure login system with sessions. We tracked changes to project using branching and merging in GIT and deployed final version to a remote server.
